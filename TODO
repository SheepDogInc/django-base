TODO:

- (probably always) bump the Django version (and any other requirements that are out of date)
- have the setup generate the secret key for the project
- use the new settings structure (settings module, with base, local, production, etc)
- add some more fabfile commands for common tasks
- have the setup ask for a PROJECT name rather than force an edit of the setup file
